# Installation
Installation consists of 3 steps:
1. [Obtain a VoIP phone number](VoIP.md)
2. [Set up the cloud PBX](PBX.md)
3. [Configure your home SIP clients](Clients.md)

# Messaging App
Since my Flowroute VoiP number comes with SMS/MMS messaging support, I figured I'd write a simple app to send/receive messages using the number.  The app works with any browser.  You can find [instructions for installing the app here](Msgapp.md).
